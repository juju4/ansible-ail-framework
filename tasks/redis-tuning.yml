# WARNING overcommit_memory is set to 0! Background save may fail under low memory condition. To fix this issue
#    add 'vm.overcommit_memory = 1' to /etc/sysctl.conf and then reboot or run the command
#    'sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1' for this to take effect.
# WARNING you have Transparent Huge Pages (THP) support enabled in your kernel. This will create latency and memory
#    usage issues with Redis. To fix this issue run the command
#    'echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled' as root, and add it to your /etc/rc.local in order
#    to retain the setting after a reboot. Redis must be restarted after THP is disabled.
